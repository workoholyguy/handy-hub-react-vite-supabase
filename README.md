## Notes

### Challenges:
1. **Implementing Authentication**:
   - Managing Supabase authentication flows and handling state changes dynamically was challenging.
   - Debugging common errors like `422 Unprocessable Content` required careful configuration of Supabase settings.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensuring the app looked good on various screen sizes required thorough testing and CSS optimization.

3. **Sorting and Filtering**:
   - Building a robust search and sort feature that scales efficiently with a growing number of posts.

4. **State Management**:
   - Managing state across components, especially with nested routes and forms, required precise React hooks.

### Future Enhancements:
- Integrate file uploads for image posting directly from the userâ€™s local machine.
- Add social media sharing functionality for posts.
- Build an admin dashboard to manage flagged or inappropriate content.
